COMS 4111 Project 1
===================

[Project 1 Name] is a recommendation and media-sharing application that uses the Youtube API to create and store recommendations for different groups, also known as parties. Users can share Youtube videos within parties, watch them together, and vote for what kinds of videos they want to share with others. The application's main entities would be _users_, _groups_, and _videos_. Like other social media platforms, users can join parties based on similar interests or relationships. For instance, users could be part of a "Hip Hop Music" party, and the application will recommend videos with _tags_ that relate to the party's interest. Each party would also have a history of videos that the party's users either liked or disliked, and this data is pulled to influence future video recommendations. Within a party, users can either be a leader or a member for that party and while members can vote whether they like certain videos, the leader gets to decide the next video to watch. Parties cannot have more than one leader at a time. Besides voting on videos, users will also be able to comment on videos directly within the group.
